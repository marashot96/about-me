# <div align="center"> 🐍 Python Skills </div>

Welcome to [my](https://github.com/marashot96/portfolio/blob/main/README-EN.md) collection of Python projects!  
Here you will find a curated selection of educational and research tasks where I applied my skills in data analysis, mathematics, and algorithmic development.  
Most of the projects demonstrate practical use of Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, as well as writing efficient and readable code.

## 🔍 Navigation

| Task | File | Short Description |
|------|------|-------------------|
| User Behavior Analysis in PaySim | [paysim_behavior_analysis.py](./paysim_behavior_analysis.py) | A project focused on behavioral analysis of mobile banking users based on the simulated PaySim dataset. The goal is to detect anomalies, assess fraud risk, and build customer segmentation models |
| Converting Arabic Numbers to Chinese Numerals | [Chinese Numeral Encoder.ipynb](/Python/Chinese%20Numeral%20Encoder.ipynb) | Implementation of complex branching based on mathematical and arithmetic logic |
| Number of Trailing Zeros in `n!` in an Arbitrary Base | [trailing_zeros_base.ipynb](/Python/trailing_zeros_base.ipynb) | <p align="justify"> A mathematical task with a universal implementation — generalizing the classical problem of trailing zeros in factorials. The program includes optimized algorithms for working with large numbers (factorials grow very rapidly) </p> |

All the files used in the programs are collected in [this](/Python/Files%20from%20progs) folder. A detailed explanation of each file’s purpose and its usage can be found [here](/Python/Files%20from%20progs/About%20this%20directory.md).
